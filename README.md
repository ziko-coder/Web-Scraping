# Web-Scraping
In this project I scraped Wikipedia to create a Disney movie dataset.<br>
I used beautifulSoup along with many other libraries. The tasks include:
<ul>
<li> Web scraping with BeautifulSoup
<li> Cleaning the Data
<li> Pattern matching with regular expressions (Re Library)
<li> Formatting Dates and budgets
<li> Saving and loading the data with Pickle
<li> Using an API (OMDb API) to get more data on Disney movies.
<li>Saving the final data in CSV format.
